## What does it do?

Have a cry about your stats every time you open a new tab!

Essentially this app allows you to view the current stats for a public overwatch account from every new page.

It's great for tracking your progress as you try climb up the competitive rankings.

## How does it work?

The stats on display will be the same as those available on https://playoverwatch.com/.

I am using https://github.com/alfg/overwatch-api to get the public data.

## Copyright info

I do not own any of the characters, names, icons, images or data displayed in this app.

This is purely for fun and to inspire people to up their win rates.

## Is it open source?

For sure! Feel free to make PRs/issues if you want.

## I found an error!
